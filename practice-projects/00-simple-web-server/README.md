# Web server for messages

A simple web server to send messages between users, with no database (data is lost after a reload since it's harcoded). Just an exercise to learn to handle express.

# Installation

Just clone the repo and run `npm install`.

# Run the server

Run `npm test` to set up the server and go to `localhost:3000` (you can change the port in the source code, there's no .env file).
